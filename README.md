## Get started

Launch this smart contract set in SettleMint under the `Smart Contract Sets` section. This will automatically link it to your own blockchain node and make use of the private keys living in the platform.

If you want to use it separately, bootstrap a new project using

```shell
forge init my-project --template settlemint/solidity-supplychain
```

Or if you want to use this set as a dependency of your own,

```shell
npm install @settlemint/solidity-supplychain
```

## DX: Foundry & Hardhat hybrid

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

- **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
- **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
- **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.

**Hardhat is a Flexible, Extensible, Fast Ethereum development environment for professionals in typescript**

Hardhat consists of:

- **Hardhat Runner**: Hardhat Runner is the main component you interact with when using Hardhat. It's a flexible and extensible task runner that helps you manage and automate the recurring tasks inherent to developing smart contracts and dApps.
- **Hardhat Ignition**: Declarative deployment system that enables you to deploy your smart contracts without navigating the mechanics of the deployment process.
- **Hardhat Network**: Declarative deployment system that enables you to deploy your smart contracts without navigating the mechanics of the deployment process.
